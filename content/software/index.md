# Software Development

I enjoy developing Open Source software and currently do so mostly in R and Python.<br>
During my PhD, I have (co-)developed several extensions for the [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3) ecosystem and contributed to several others. 

# mlr3

- [mlr3pipelines](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines/): Machine learning pipelines for **mlr3**.<br>
    M. Binder, **F. Pfisterer**, M. Lang, L. Schneider, L. Kotthoff, and B. Bischl. mlr3pipelines - flexible machine learning pipelines in R. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 22(184):1â€“7, 2021
- [mlr3fairness](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fairness/): Bias Audits for **mlr3**.<br>

    mlr3fairness
- [mlr3keras](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3keras/): Deep Learning with **keras** and **mlr3**.<br>
  A first attempt to integrate **keras** with mlr3. Superseded by [mlr3torch](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3torch).

- [mlr3torch](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3torch/): Deep Learning with **torch** and **mlr3**.<br>
  I help developing mlr3torch mainly in a supervisory capacity.

# R

- [mlr3pipelines](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines/) 
  Machine learning pipelines for **mlr3**.
- [mlr3fairness](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fairness/) 
  Auditing, visualization and bias mitigation for learners from **mlr3**.
- [Deepregression](https://github.com/neural-structured-additive-learning/deepregression): Fitting Semi-Structured Deep Distributional Regression in R
- [mcboost](https://github.com/mlr-org/mcboost/): Multi-calibration and multi-accuracy boosting.<br>
    **F. Pfisterer**, C. Kern, S. Dandl, M. Sun, M. P. Kim, and B. Bischl. mcboost: Multi-
    calibration boosting for R. Journal of Open Source Software, 6(64):3453, 2021
- [AutoxgboostMC](https://github.com/ja-thomas/autoxgboostMC):
  A simplistic AutoML system based on tuning **xgboost** models.
- [YAHPO Gym](https://github.com/slds-lmu/yahpo_gym):
  An R Interface to the Pyhon YAHPO Gym library.

# Python 

- [YAHPO Gym](https://github.com/slds-lmu/yahpo_gym):
  A multi-objective multi-fidelity benchmark for HPO optimizers.
  For this paper, I developed software to interface surrogates and a tiny AutoML system that allows fitting surrogate models for use with YAHPO Gym called `yahpo_train`.


# Web

- [MCML](https://mcml.ai/): I created the initial website for the Munich Center of Machine Learing (MCML).
