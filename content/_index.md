description: 
    I currently work at [hema.to](https://hema.to), where I apply machine learning to build diagnostic support for blood cancer diagnosis and monitoring.
    In my free time, I am available to work on interesting problems as a freelance data science consultant.
    In 2022, I completed a PhD in statistics at the [Statistical Learning and Data Science](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/) chair at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html) supervised by [Bernd Bischl](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/).
    My research focuses on AutoML, Algorithmic Fairness and Benchmarking. 
    My current interests lie in practical aspects of algorithmic fairness and how practitioners can be enabled to develop more equitable algorithms.
    I also develop Open Source software,  either in Python or for the [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3) ecosystem in R.
